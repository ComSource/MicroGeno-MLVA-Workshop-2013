## Abstract

MicroGeno is a still-in-development open web platform used to facilitate
pathogenic bacteria strain genotyping. This project emerged from the strong
collaboration between TailorDev and the most talented academic researchers of
the field.

MicroGeno mainly focuses on user experience and massively online collaborative
working. It aims to provide a easy-to-use toolbox for managing, querying and
analyzing collections of bacterial genotyping data. The platform is not
dedicated to a particular species, but intend to be as generalist as it may be.

During my talk, I will introduce MicroGeno main features with a live demo of the
application.
